### Results
This analysis results are summarized as follows:
- Majority of the employee agrees to know what is expected from them at work, while majority disagrees with having best friend at work.
- The high rate of positive response indicates good working environment.
- The sheriff department recorded the lowest rate of satisfaction.
- The planning department has the highest number of responses, which indicate bias in the result compared to other department with low response.
